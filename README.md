# acoustic-models
A collection of various acoustic modeling techniques that have been useful to me over the years.

The repository contains the following:

- parabolic_equation_solver: uses an IFD approach to solve the parabolic approximation of the wave equation.
- ray_trace: plots ray traces for input launch angles given a sound speed profile
