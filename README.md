# acoustic-models
A collection of various acoustic modeling techniques that have been useful to me over the years.

The repository contains the following:

- ParabolicWaveEquationSolver: a class that contains an IFD solution method to the parabolic wave equation.
- PropagationEnvironment: a class that contains information about a propagation environment.
- ray_trace: plots ray traces for input launch angles given a sound speed profile.
